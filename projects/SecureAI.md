**Goal 1:**
The agent should be able to scan source code for potential security vulnerabilities using techniques like static code analysis, dynamic testing, and machine learning models trained on vulnerability patterns

**Goal 2:**
Once vulnerabilities are detected, the agent should provide automated fix suggestions or be able to directly modify the code to remediate the issues.

**Goal 3:**
Support a wide range of programming languages commonly used in software development, such as JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python, C/C++, C#, Go, etc.

**Goal 4:**
The vulnerability scanning and remediation capabilities should be tightly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, enabling continuous security checks and fixes as code changes are made.

**Goal 5:**
The agent should provide clear explanations for detected vulnerabilities and the rationale behind suggested fixes to aid developer understanding and trust in the system.

**Goal 6:**
Integrate the agent into popular integrated development environments (IDEs) to provide real-time vulnerability detection and fix suggestions as developers write code.
