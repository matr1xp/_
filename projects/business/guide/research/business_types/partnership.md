# Partnership Business Structure in Australia

## Definition and Characteristics
A partnership is a business structure involving two or more individuals or entities who carry on a business together with the goal of generating profit. In Australia, partnerships can have between 2 and 20 partners (with some exceptions for professional partnerships).

### Key Characteristics
- Shared decision-making among partners
- Shared responsibilities and potential profits
- Each partner contributes resources (capital, property, labor, or skill)
- Partners share control and management of the business
- Not a separate legal entity from its partners

## Types of Partnerships
1. **General Partnership**: All partners are equally responsible for management and share unlimited liability
2. **Limited Partnership**: Combines general partners (with management control and unlimited liability) and limited partners (with limited liability and no management control)
3. **Incorporated Limited Partnership**: Used primarily for venture capital investments with specific regulatory requirements

## Advantages
- **Relatively Simple to Establish**: Less formal than a company structure
- **Shared Resources**: Combined capital, skills, and labor from multiple partners
- **Shared Responsibility**: Distribution of workload and decision-making
- **Tax Flexibility**: Partnership itself doesn't pay tax; profits pass through to partners
- **Privacy**: Less public information required compared to companies
- **Lower Setup and Operating Costs**: Compared to company structures

## Disadvantages
- **Joint and Several Liability**: Partners are personally liable for business debts, including those incurred by other partners
- **Shared Control**: Decision-making authority is divided, potentially leading to disputes
- **Lack of Perpetual Succession**: Partnership may need to be dissolved if a partner leaves
- **Potential for Conflict**: Disagreements between partners can impact business operations
- **Limited Ability to Raise Capital**: Cannot issue shares like a company

## Registration Process
1. Apply for an Australian Business Number (ABN) for the partnership
2. Register the partnership business name (if operating under a name other than partners' names)
3. Create a comprehensive partnership agreement (highly recommended though not legally required)
4. Register for relevant taxes (GST if turnover exceeds $75,000)
5. Obtain necessary licenses and permits specific to your industry

## Tax Implications
- Partnership itself is not a taxable entity
- Partnership lodges an annual partnership tax return showing income distribution
- Each partner reports their share of partnership income in their individual tax returns
- Partners pay tax at their individual income tax rates
- Partnership must have its own Tax File Number (TFN)
- Required to lodge Business Activity Statements (BAS) if registered for GST

## Legal Obligations
- Maintain accurate financial records for at least 5 years
- Lodge annual partnership tax returns
- Each partner must lodge individual tax returns including their share of partnership income
- Comply with industry-specific regulations and standards
- Obtain necessary licenses and permits
- Comply with consumer law and fair trading regulations

## Partnership Agreement
While not legally required, a formal partnership agreement is strongly recommended to cover:
- Capital contributions of each partner
- Profit and loss sharing arrangements
- Management responsibilities and decision-making processes
- Procedures for resolving disputes
- Process for admitting new partners or handling partner departures
- Dissolution procedures

## Suitability
The partnership structure is most suitable for:
- Professional service providers (accountants, lawyers, doctors)
- Family businesses
- Businesses where complementary skills are beneficial
- Situations where shared resources and responsibilities are advantageous
- Businesses requiring more capital than a sole trader can provide
