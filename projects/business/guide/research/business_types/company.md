# Company Business Structure in Australia

## Definition and Characteristics
A company is a more complex business structure that exists as a separate legal entity from its owners (shareholders). In Australia, companies are regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) and governed by the Corporations Act 2001.

### Key Characteristics
- Separate legal entity distinct from its shareholders
- Limited liability for shareholders
- Perpetual succession (continues to exist regardless of changes in shareholders)
- Formal governance requirements
- Regulated by ASIC
- Has its own rights and responsibilities

## Types of Companies
1. **Proprietary Limited (Pty Ltd)**: Most common for small to medium businesses
   - Limited to 50 non-employee shareholders
   - Cannot raise funds from the public
   - Simpler reporting requirements than public companies

2. **Public Company Limited by Shares (Ltd)**: Can raise capital from the public
   - Can list on the stock exchange
   - No limit on number of shareholders
   - More extensive reporting and compliance requirements

3. **Company Limited by Guarantee**: Typically used for non-profit organizations
   - Members guarantee a nominal amount in case of winding up
   - No share capital or dividends

4. **Unlimited Company**: Shareholders have unlimited liability
   - Rarely used in practice

## Advantages
- **Limited Liability**: Shareholders' personal assets are generally protected
- **Separate Legal Entity**: Can own assets, sue and be sued in its own name
- **Perpetual Succession**: Business continues despite changes in ownership
- **Tax Benefits**: Flat company tax rate (potentially lower than individual rates)
- **Capital Raising Potential**: Easier to attract investors and raise funds
- **Professional Image**: May be perceived as more credible and established
- **Ownership Transfer**: Shares can be transferred more easily than other structures

## Disadvantages
- **Higher Setup and Maintenance Costs**: Registration fees and ongoing compliance costs
- **Complex Regulatory Requirements**: More extensive reporting and record-keeping
- **Less Privacy**: Company information is publicly available through ASIC
- **Double Taxation Potential**: Profits taxed at company level and dividends may be taxed at shareholder level
- **Less Control**: Directors have legal responsibilities to the company that may override shareholder wishes

## Registration Process
1. Choose a company name and check its availability
2. Identify company officers (directors and secretary)
3. Determine share structure and shareholders
4. Prepare a company constitution or adopt replaceable rules
5. Register the company with ASIC (can be done online)
6. Receive Certificate of Registration and Australian Company Number (ACN)
7. Apply for an Australian Business Number (ABN)
8. Register for relevant taxes (GST, PAYG, FBT)

## Tax Implications
- Companies pay tax on their profits at the company tax rate
  - 25% for base rate entities (turnover less than $50 million)
  - 30% for all other companies
- Dividends distributed to shareholders may be franked (tax credits attached)
- Required to lodge annual company tax returns
- Must lodge Business Activity Statements (BAS)
- May need to register for Pay As You Go (PAYG) withholding for employees
- Potential Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) obligations

## Legal Obligations

- Lodge annual company tax returns with the ATO
- Hold annual general meetings (public companies)
- Notify ASIC of changes to company details
- Maintain a registered office
