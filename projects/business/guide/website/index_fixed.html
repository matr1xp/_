                        <div class="faq-question">What's the difference between a business name and a company name?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                            <p>A business name is simply a name under which you conduct your business. It doesn't create a separate legal entity. You register a business name with ASIC if you're a sole trader, partnership, or trust trading under a name other than your own.</p>
                            <p>A company name belongs to a company, which is a separate legal entity registered under the Corporations Act. When you register a company with ASIC, you receive an Australian Company Number (ACN) and the company name is registered automatically.</p>
                            <p>Key differences:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Business name registration doesn't provide legal ownership or exclusive rights to that name</li>
                                <li>Company registration creates a separate legal entity with its own rights and obligations</li>
                                <li>A company can own assets, sue and be sued in its own name</li>

                            <p>The best structure depends on your specific circumstances, but for many small startups, a sole trader structure offers several advantages:</p>
